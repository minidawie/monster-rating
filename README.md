Lmfao, no one else is gonna see this but us. But hey if you're reading this, and your name isn't David Koh or William Chung,.......idk go get a job or somethin. Dafuq you doin over here. 

Also, at the moment we don't have textures for the can, as that's still a work in progress. We promise in the future that the can will change when the flavors change.

May also try to scrap flavors from monster's website to update with all the flavors

  - [ ] have a button to add new drink
    - [ ] auto adds other persons review to dafault values
    - [ ] idk how we gonna add color but maybe color wheel?
  - [ ] within review page there can be a little edit button to change values
