This thing is absolutely trash. It takes the worst of the original monster and the worst of the zero sugar drinks and put them together. I took this to pull an all nighter for a midterm because I didn't watch a single lecture for the past 4 weeks but I would rather fall asleep or work on pure willpower alone than drink this. (carbonated)" },
        {"critic": "William Chung", "type":"Energy", "flavor": "Original Zero Sugar", "rating": -0.2, "review": "The geniuses at Monster really looked at their original and said \"Yeah customers would want a zero-sugar version\"? Nah this is an absolute abomination, and I wouldn't be too surprised that this flavor only fairs well with obese fucks who think that a zero-sugar energy drink is what's keeping them alive. People who drink and enjoy the zero-sugar version are the type of fuckers who would drink a diet pepsi and say \"This is great! I absolutely feel like I'm on a diet\" when in reality, they're 2 fries away from the most painful heart attack known to man. I genuinely believe feeding this to a prisoner of war as a replacement for water is something that even Satan himself wouldn't do. There ya go CIA/FBI, I just gave you a new torture method, use it wisely." },

        {"critic": "William Chung", "type":"Ultra", "flavor": "Ultra Strawberry Dreams", "rating": 0.60, "review": "I'm not gonna lie, the can is slightly deceiving. Just think \"Hello-Kitty girl\". Its extremely nice and sweet appearance lulls you into a false sense of confidence, and buddy, if you thought you were the one that could \"fix her\", think again. Not only is this drink sweet, but that taste of strawberry is so quickly diminished by the strong carbonation and all the other ingredients, it's not even funny." },
        {"critic": "David Koh", "type":"Ultra", "flavor": "Ultra Violet", "rating": 0.55, "review": "This tastes like grape and fruit-punch caprisun mixed.

Gives me PTSD from everytime I would get sick and my mom would feed me 5 month expired vitamin c powder because in her eyes if it look and smell ok then it is ok. I swear I would be on the verge of throwing up everytime I would have to ingest that concoction and this drink reminds me of that exact taste. Would not recommend. (carbonated) " },

You know that feeling, when you have really bad tonsillitis, and you're forced to drink those vitamin-C drinks to boost your immune system, but instead of helping you, all it does is burn the back of your already sore throat? Yeah, think that, except, like a million times worse. Like, I'm already sick and feeling like shit from studying and working with 0-4 hours of sleep, WHY DAFUQ WOULD I DO THAT TO MY OWN BODY. Anybody who enjoys drinking this shit is genuinely a psychopath, and you gotta watch out for them if you can \uD83D\uDC40." },

        {"critic": "William Chung", "type":"Ultra", "flavor": "Ultra Peachy Keen", "rating": 0.60, "review": "Being absolutely honest, it really isn't that bad. I'd say the first time you try it, it hits, but its kinda like masturbation. That first feeling makes you feel like you just discovered fire. But as you mature, you realize there are way better peach flavored drinks out there for you that will cuddle you, listen to you, buy you gifts, and make you feel good, but they're too expensive, so this is all you've got. What I'm trying to say is, you get really tired of this flavor pretty quickly, but I've never had a girlfriend, so what would I know?" },

I was really excited because of the whole \"vice city\" collab, but this just feels basic. What I mean by that is, you get the kick of guava right at the beginning, and then it just disappears, leaving you with that familiar taste that all these monster zero sugar drinks have. That's why I was hesitant on giving out the full score. Like the guava aspect, but the rest of the drink quickly nulls everything. It's kinda just like banging your good friend (Ian for me) with a condom, except when you're both finished, both of you just lay there like \"damn that's it?\" because there was really no excitement in the climax due to the condom cock blocking everything. Disappointing to say the least, especially since the presentation of the can itself really lures you into a false sense of high expectation. Doesn't deserve anything above a 6 in my professional opinion, but it's worth trying at least once. " },

The presentation of this can was absurdly luring, but its just a WORSE guava drink than the Vice Guava?! And also, does Monster not realize that the color of guava is NOT red, pink, and blue? You know what this shit is? It's like taking the most breathtaking girl you see on a date, taking her ass back home, and then finding out she has a penis. Bro I had to finish the can out of guilt to my debit card, like NAH dawg this one ain't it." },

Extremely fucking sweet, and I can genuinely feel my heart beating out of my fucking rib cage when drinking this. I'm not a big fan of either this or the fiesta mango, but if I had to fucking choose a mango flavored energy drink, it's definitely not this one. Carbonated (I have no idea why this line is called juice if it's all carbonated), tastes like super sweet mango snapple or the trident mango gum, and quite frankly, if your grandma or grandpa flat-lines and all seems lost, do yourself a favor: don't give them cpr, just pour this drink into their mouths and I guarantee you their hearts will jump-start again." },

Some people will like this, and I say that's fine, but if one drink can give me 10 cavities simultaneously, I'm not too keen on drinking this on a daily basis, even IF I have a shit ton of work to do. Carbonated (once again I have no idea why this line is called juice if it's all carbonated), if you wanna drink hawaiian punch and stress test your cardiovascular system at the same time, then I guess this is the drink for you." },

        {"critic": "David Koh", "type":"Tea", "flavor": "Wild Berry Tea", "rating": 1.0, "review": "Totally unbiased opinion but it tastes like my go to order at teacision: blackberry black tea. Absolutely goated drink, non-carbonated, and 10/10 would buy again." },

This is monsters attempt at culturally appropriating us asians because the way that the sugary sweetness hit my tongue was an insulting to us tea lovers.

The person who thought of this deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to humanity. If I could, I would drink this drink and give the creator of this a nice strawberry and lemonade blowjob. Holy fuck this shit is soooo good. I would argue that this flavor ranks in the top 5 of any drinks I've ever had in my life. This drink has given me a new perspective on Strawberry Lemonade, so much so, that I have convinced myself that if my future SO doesn't have a strawberry lemonade lipstick on and ain't kissing me with that scent, I will do humanity a favor and just get rid of their existence on this planet. Non carbonated, and is just the definition of perfection. I promise you Merriam Webster will change their definition of perfection from \"the quality or state of being perfect\" to just \"Monster Strawberry Lemonade Rehab\"." }
